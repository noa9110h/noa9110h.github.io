# Something To Say

### About Myself

I am a college student in cyber security. And I'm currently mostly learning the basics on tryhackme. This site is established for the convenience of posting some summaries, ctf wp, documents, etc.

### Website construction process

##### 1. Free server

At the beginning, I planned to follow the Youtube video to build a website based on a free platform

But free things are really troublesome. The theme is blocked because of the anti-abuse system,.

So I turned to GitHub

##### 2. Jeckyll

This chirpy theme really attracts me

Concise and generous, very suitable for me

But there are many detours when the environment is dependent on the construction

chirpy doc:

At the beginning, I used Linux to build it, but I couldnâ€™t use the bundler because dont have write permissions. 

find this way worked but still cant use bundle 

```bash
cd /var/lib
sudo chmod -R a+w gems/
```

Finally, I switched to Windows and it was so smooth that I felt like im totally idiot who was stuck with Linux a few days ago. . .

##### 3. Video guidance
